The program is a basic role playing game generator under conctruction. It is generating the characters, handling the fights and able to use equipment system.
I was using singleton for the arrayList, strategy for the combat stances, decorator for the equipment. All GOF and SOLID rules were carefully watched and not violated 
except one overwrite for the easier sorting of an array.
I made a unit test for checking an implemented caste's attributes.
